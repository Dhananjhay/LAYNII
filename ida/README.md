# Notes for LayNii IDA (Integrated Development/Discovery Application)

- Use `make clean` then `make LayNii_IDA` inside `src` folder.
- `make clean && make LayNii_IDA` for quick clean and compile.
- It is strongly recommended to use `g++` compiler (e.g. `brew install gcc`). This boost optimization results significantly compared to `c++` when using `-O3`.
